# Codesmith Hackathon: Realtime Chat for Web Pages!

This is a Chrome extension that adds a little chat box so you can chat with people on the same web page!

## Install

Just clone this repo, then load it in Chrome as a "Unpacked Extension".

## Server

You probably need a server for this as well. In essence, we used [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) to relay our messages. The server doesn't stores the message whatsoever!

You can refer to our server code [here](https://github.com/applefreak/cs-hackathon-chat-app-server).

## Thanks for looking!
